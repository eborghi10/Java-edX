public class MultiThreading {

    /**
     * When a customer enters to the Movie Theater, he or she is assigned to one of the queues,
     * depending on which movie he or she wants to watch.
     * When it is the customerâ€™s turn to buy a ticket, an attendant asks the customer which movie
     * ticket he or she wants to buy.
     *
     * The attendant takes a certain time to complete the transaction because the attendant must verify
     * if tickets are available for the movie in order to sell them to the customer. If there are available
     * tickets for the movie that the customer wants, the customer buys one and exits the queue. This means
     * that the program must subtract one ticket from the available tickets of the corresponding movie because
     * it was sold.
     *
     * If there are no tickets available for the movie that the customer wants, he or she exits the movie
     * theater without buying. This means that the customer leaves the simulated queue and tickets are not
     * changed.  When all the tickets from all the movies are sold, the Movie Theater closes (End the program).
     *
     *
     * On this Movie Theater there are 15 movies and 5 Queues, there is one attendant on each queue and each
     * of them sell tickets for 3 movies. Every movie has 50 tickets available when the Movie Theater open
     * (The program start).
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * Your task is to bring to life this Movie Theater by implementing the simulation and using the classes
     * from the file MultiThreading.java. The list of movies (the names) are on the file movies.txt you should read
     * from the file and get the movies, assign 3 movies for each attendant.
     *
     * In the main method, write the code to read the movies names, assign them to the movie stock, instantiate
     * the threads and start them. In the Customer class, complete the information. Every Customer has an ID and
     * what movie he wants to watch as attributes.
     *
     * Complete MovieTicketsStock class, assign the movies and the available tickets for every movie. Complete
     * the sellTicket method. Hint: use arrays of two dimensions, or HashMaps.
     *
     * Complete MovieQueues class, in enterCustomer() method remember to enter a customer at the end of each
     * correct queue depending on what movie he or she wishes to watch. In the attendCustomer() method,
     * remember to the remove the first customer and if there are no customers, return null. Also, specify
     * from what queue a customer is attended.
     *
     * The Entry class is a Thread that generates randomly a new Customer with a random movie and invokes the
     * enterCustomer() method. There are 15 movies to choose. And generates a customer every 1 to 3 seconds.
     *
     * The Attender class is a Thread, assigns every attender to one queue, and this one just sold 3 different
     * movies. Each customer he attends will take certain random time (3 to 5 seconds) to complete a
     * transaction. Use attendCustomer() method to attend a customer, if there are no customers in queue,
     * wait 1 second before invoking it again.
     *
     * Every time a Customer enters a queue print the information, use the following format:
     *
     * Format:
     * Customer#(id) enters the queue (number) in (time) seconds
     *
     * Example:
     * Customer#20 enters the queue 4 in 3 seconds
     *
     * Every time a Customer is attended (after the waiting time) print the information depending if the
     * ticket for the movie is available or not. Use this
     *
     * Format:
     * Customer#(id) from queue (number) buys ticket after (time) seconds for the movie (name)
     * Customer#(id) from queue (number) leaves queue. No tickets available for the movie (name)
     *
     * Example:
     * Customer#15 from queue 1 buys ticket after 4 seconds for the movie Star Trek Beyond
     * Customer#31 from queue 3 leaves queue. No tickets available for the movie Justice League
     *
     * If you want, create an extra class that prints the actual state of all the queues and the tickets stock.
     * When all the tickets are sold you should end the program and print: Movie Theater Closes.
